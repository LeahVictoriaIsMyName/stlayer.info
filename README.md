# stlayer.info
Source code for the original stlayer.info, using data recovered that would be lost to time without a reconstruction.
Hello, welcome to my repo, so let me tell you a story, well, actually im too lazy to actually remember something, so ill quote what the MIPS Conspiracy Wiki as its the most accurate explanation.

"stlayer.info was a bizarre website on the internet that displays "cursed imagery" from or relating to Super Mario 64. Going onto a nonexistent subpage would cause a 404 error with an inverted Wario face simply stating "Leave." However, the site has since gone down and no longer exists. An archive of the site exists on the Wayback Machine."

So ill try to reconstruct this bizarre webpage and ill give it officially to FryingPain to let this webpage on his server or webpage.
